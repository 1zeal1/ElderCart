Yoo mb boys I overslept
Can someone fill me in
ving — Today at 3:05 PM
We were just talking about what to do for wednesday's assignment but didn't talk about who's gonna do what
are you free to meet at 5 today?
zealium — Today at 3:11 PM
Yeah forsure
For the task to implement we should just display some search results in eldercart style 
ving — Today at 3:18 PM
So we got our grades back from the ta and they said that task doesn't work and that we should change it to something else
we were thinking of showing the security page thing since they didn't mark points off for that task
zealium — Today at 3:23 PM
damn that was supposed to be the one thing that made us unique
i think if we made our prototype better he wouldnt have tripped but our prototype was literally amazon with horizontal scrolling SMH
but its ok placing an order is just as easy of a task and we can still make our final project look nice even though we got an A- on the prototype
@ving you wanted to use mern/nodejs or was that obed
ving — Today at 3:25 PM
gotcha that works
that was obed
do u have any experience w web dev by any chance 
zealium — Today at 3:27 PM
ya but with outdated API's like JSF and EJB. I learned in CS 4336 Advanced Java
if we use those ill have a pretty good template already from that class
i think
if not mern didnt seem that bad my friend was showing me the backend but ive never used java script
have u used mern/nodejs? what are u comfortable with when it comes to web dev
ving — Today at 3:32 PM
if u have the template, maybe we can start with that since we only have a couple days left? we can switch over after the progress check
I haven't used mern or nodejs, I have some experience w bootstrap tho
zealium — Today at 3:33 PM
ok lets check it out in our meeting. I havent opened it yet but i looked and remembered it was a thing to buy movie tickets so it might even be more than what we need 🔥
ving — Today at 3:33 PM
oh nicee
@Gandalf7heGr8 will 5 work for you?
Gandalf7heGr8 — Today at 3:56 PM
Ya that’s works. I would have to leave around 6:20ish because i have a meeting at 7
ving — Today at 5:11 PM
